                        <p class="post-intro">
                            The final project for Cornell's 3110 OCaml course. Myself and two students: <b>Nicolas
                                Vega</b> and
                            <b>Haashim Shah</b> created this terminal based Monopoly Game. The game works as exactly
                            like real Monopoly,
                            however, Chance and Comm. Chest are not implemented.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We designed the game to be extremely robust utilizing <b>protected modules</b> that could only
                            interface with each other in a strict hierarchy using specific functions to limit side effects causing errors.
                            This standardized structure allowed for 
                            indepth testing and error handling such that the game follows a logical path to develop, modify, and debug.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Notable items: we were not allowed to use a GUI, and the project was completed over the course of six
                            weeks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I worked primarily on the <b>board printer and test suite</b> as well as helping the development of
                            the properties class.

                            <p class="post-intro">
                                With no GUI use allowed, I was tasked with coming up with a fast way to effectively
                                print the board each turn.
                                I created a <b>[grid coord tuple : property string]</b> dictionary.
                                This worked well because the board was hard coded and very little changed each turn.
                                This allowed us to
                                alter coordinates on a logical grid instead of a non-standardized board shape.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A simple loop could print each 'square' of the grid and dictionary look ups are quite
                                fast
                                therefore it was a great solution to the issue of not having access to a GUI.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Example: P1 moves from Go (position (31,11) in the grid) to Vermont Ave (position (31,3) in the grid).
                                We simply update the dictionary entry with key (33,3) to have the value P1, and remove that value from thw
                                entry with key (33,11). View video for reference.

                            <p class="post-intro">
                                I volunteered to write the required test suite as I had just read how to utilize both <b>black and white
                                box testing</b> to ensure game/method correctness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>Black Box:</b> I created many premade game states to test the possible playable games. Then I ran
                                moves on those - checking correctness along the way.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>White Box:</b> I also tested each function individually on multitudes of input output combinations to
                                ensure
                                each method followed expected behavior even when not in a game state.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally we performed many hours of <b>play testing</b>, and error handle checks to ensure no
                                side effects caused fatal crashes.

                    <h4>More about the project</h4>
                    <p>
                        This taught me a tremendous amount about proper program structure and the importance of
                        <b>abstracting certain tasks</b> from the user and from other functions within a program.
                        Alongside this, I learned how to: code with a test driven strategy, work effectively in a group,
                        use pattern matching, recursion, and how to program in a <b>functional language.</b>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I hihgly recommend recreating simple games in new languages as a way to learn the syntax and semantics in a 
                        fun effective way.

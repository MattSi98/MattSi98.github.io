                        <p class="post-intro">
                            This project was completed by Myself, Erie Adams, and Nicholas Robinson, as the final
                            project for our Artificial Intelligence Practicum.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The goal was to create a game-like program where users could edit the attributes of the
                            rockets
                            in attempt to see how different factors effect Genetic Algorithms. Users can alter: mutation
                            rate, speed, number of agents, and turn frequency.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rockets then must complete different mazes, forcing the user to improve their parameters
                            - thus enforcing their understanding of the algorithm. The <b>fitness function </b>was the
                            most difficult aspect of this project. We settled on using a distance and time based
                            function -
                            rewarding rockets that got close to the goal quickly. We also used many different <b>mating
                                strategies</b>, settling on each rocket getting 1/2 of its 'genes' from either parent
                            (randomly
                            chosen from most fit agents). The 'genes' are acceleration vectors which the rocket follows
                            post spawn, and are chosen: odds from parent 1 and evens from parent 2.
                            Rockets were limited to 50 genes - thus extremely long courses are not viable.

                                We tried many fitness functions to determine the 'success' of each rocket.
                                For example, minimum distance to target, shortest time to target, least 'genes' used,
                                etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We found that a combination of minimum distance and minimum time worked best. We added a
                                large <b>multiplier</b> to those rockets that did reach the target. This ensures that
                                the
                                rockets converge on a successful set of 'genes' very quickly once a few succeed.

                            <p class="post-intro">
                                Mutations were a tricky aspect of the project. Many different mutation rates seemed to work
                                well.
                                This goes against the common notion that faster/more mutations would cause the rockets
                                to succeed faster/more frequently.
                                However, this <b>did not seem to be the case</b> (at least on the limited amount of maps
                                we
                                tested on).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus, we chose to let the user alter this as well, and simply start it at a successful
                                default value, which we determined during testing.

                    <p>
                        To the right is the hardest map. This took our best rockets over 200 generations to complete.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A large breakthrough in getting the rockets to train faster was to implement a <b>pseudo
                            memory.</b>
                        Allowing rockets to have <b>checkpoints</b>, which if they made it to, would lock their genes.
                        This
                        removed the need to relearn earlier parts of the course, and drastically decreased the number of
                        generations it took to complete harder mazes.

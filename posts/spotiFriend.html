                            Location based <b>music discovery/playlist app</b>. Users place custom markers on
                            the world map,
                            and can search for other playlist markers created by users. Playlist markers only appear if
                            the user is in
                            range of them, thereby creating incentive to <b>explore</b> areas around the globe and discover their
                            musical tastes.
                            Each playlist is linked to a Spotify playlist, and when tapped will
                            take the user to that playlist and begin playback.

                            Master playlists are curated playlists that are location specific and are intended to be a

                            User playlists can be placed anywhere, by any user, and can contain any music style.
                            The master playlists stay on the map indefinitley, while user generated markers will be
                            deleted weekly. This ensures the world map remains usable over time.

                                Users can change their <b>profile picture</b>, which will change the annotation that is placed
                                on the map when they create a playlist (as seen above).

                                A user can add a playlist to any location on the world map - they do not need to be
                                there physically.
                                This allows users the ability to <b>share their music passion globally</b> - without the need
                                for travel.

                            </p>

                                However, users can only see playlists that are near their physical location - which
                                maintains the
                                main theme of location based music discovery.

                                The key tool behind th eentire app is Firebase - a Database provided by Google.
                                I became quite adept at using this service as it handles: user authentication, all map
                                data, all userInfo, and all playlist data.
                                Firebase user <b>authentication</b> is wonderful and made creating profiles/log in/sign up
                                seamless and easy.
                                The Firestore <b>Database</b> is used to handle all userInfo, and playlist data - such as
                                location, date created, author, titiel, etc.
                                Finally, I used the <b>Storage</b> feature to store the user's profile pictures.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I also adopted a simple node JS script to easily upload all of the many curated master
                                playlists. This provided a fast scalable way
                                to import large amounts of data. Firebase also offers plans that scale with the size of
                                the
                                project from free -> paid. I cannot recommend this service enough, and I am extremely
                                glad that I learned hwo to use it effectively.

                            This app is designed to implement an easy way to explore the music of any region that a user
                            is currently in.
                            For example, while on travel a user can look to see the playlists being shared near them, to
                            get a  <b>preview
                                of the local music scene</b>. The user can also find the curated playlists which are more formal
                            introductions
                            to local artists.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is also a platform that will hopefully <b>generate a community</b> of passionate music lovers
                            who use the app to
                            share music tastes gloablly. Any user can place their favorite playlist at any location, and
                            can therefore share their best playlists
                            to other users around the world. I hope the app will be used to share music styles across
                            great distances and create a community
                            from people who would otherwise just be strangers.

                    <h4>More about the project</h4>
                    <p>
                        I undertook this project to learn the tools and the process of creating mobile IOS apps. I chose
                        to do this during the <b>COVID-19</b>
                        lockdown as the pandemic had sidetracked my work opportunities, and I wanted to use the time to
                        be productive and follow this idea.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Previously, I had never owned or used a Mac, so it is fair to say that the journey began there.
                        I started, in my typical fashon, of jumping right into development. This was a mistake.
                        I soon realized that relying on 3yrs of CS courses <b style="color: red;">(Go Big Red)</b> and a few videos on xCode/Swift
                        was not going to produce the product that I envisioned.
                        Therefore, I enrolled in a <b>Udemy course</b> that taught me everything I needed to know to get
                        started. The course walked me through: how to use xCode, I earned two levels of certification
                        for Swift 5, and taught me how to post the final product on the AppStore. This foundation of
                        basics allowed me to
                        create a logical roadmap on <b>Trello</b>, and to truly begin development!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I began development in early July of 2020, and am currently (Sept 2020) in the process of
                        deploying version 1.0 of my app to the <b>IOS AppStore</b>.
                        I intend to update the app and continue to add features during the year.
                    </p>
